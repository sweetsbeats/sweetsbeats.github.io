# Heya
Heya, I'm sweets. This site is a repository for me to catalog my thoughts on a variety of topics, mainly to do with programming, language learning, life stuff, or anything else that comes to mind. 

## More About Me

## Some beliefs

### Privacy
Our modern world is built on top of, and as a consiquence, is entirely dependant on the internet. Data harvesting, tracking, attention hacking, etc. have become commonplace and accepted practice in the pursuit to make modern tech companies profitable, giving private companies free reign to slowly chip away at our right to privacy, as we trade it away in small chunks for convenience and creature comforts. 

To live a life either in apathy, or hostility to these conditions is an increasingly difficult and isolating endeavour, but nonetheless a neccesary one.
