Let’s face it, most people who learn Japanese nowadays do so because of anime and manga. These cultural motivations aren’t bad, they’re what’s motivated me for so long, but somewhere along the way my motivations have grown and adapted along the way to include a much wider variety of media, namely books.</p><p>For a lot of modern Japanese learners, reading books tends not to be a very big motivator, and understandably tends to scare off most learners. Thousands of unique words and kanji with no visual aid towers over you, a menacing, steep cliff that will shake off and filter anyone who isn’t a “true expert”. Even with all the right gear, practicing on easier books still feels incredibly hard.</p><p>Why is this?</p><p>In my opinion, this is because books demand a few important things that I don’t think most learners are prepared for.</p><h3 id=vocab>Vocab:</h3><p>Unless you&rsquo;re reading picture books, everything that happens in a story has to be described to us through text. Even picture books don&rsquo;t show you everything, and comic books still have speech. Instead of watching a series of actions play out like in a TV show or movie, the actions are instead described to us, and these kinds of third person descriptor words are not something most learners have experience with.</p><h3 id=grammar>Grammar:</h3><p>Books are long, and just like any other language authors want to avoid sounding repetitive, hence books tend to contain a very diverse set of grammar points. Not understanding a noun, adverb, etc. can be remedied with a lookup, however understanding the underlying meaning of some grammar points will vary significantly in difficulty and time consumption. While some people can tolerate this level of ambiguity and move on, this can cause issues in your reading further on if you happen to miss some important or critical piece of information.</p><h3 id=reading-ability>“Reading Ability”:</h3><p>This one is a sort of catch 22. Let’s refer to one’s “reading ability” in this section, as the ability to read some text without major hiccups or pauses, and at reasonable words per minute depending on the difficulty of the text.</p><p>Even in your native language, if you don’t read regularly, your natural reading ability will be slow or stilted. If your natural reading ability in a language is low, you will find it harder or unenjoyable to read, and if you find reading difficult or unenjoyable, then you most likely aren’t going to read regularly. This negative feedback loop also happens with languages we’re learning, which in the case of Japanese, can be greatly amplified by its cumbersome writing system.</p><p>Taking these points into account, it’s easy to see why many end up plateauing in their Japanese learning journey at around the N3 point. Becoming complacent with being able to watch some anime without translated subtitles, being able to read manga even if at a snail’s pace; these motivating factors are mistaken for, or settled for as the end goal, instead of a milestone.</p><p>The reality is, is that the time investment to reach what most people would consider &ldquo;fluency&rdquo; in Japanese is an endless grind that demands
thousands of hours, and for those hours has the worst yield in terms of fluency. Japanese is a language that requires every last language learning tip, trick, hack, and technique in order to even come close to learning it in a normal timeframe.</p></div></section></article></main><div class="w-full h-0 flex-none order-3"></div><aside role=contentinfo class="w-full md:w-2/5 xl:w-1/2 md:pr-12 lg:pr-20 xl:pr-24 order-4 md:order-3 md:sticky md:bottom-0 self-end max-w-2xl"><div class="md:float-right md:text-right leading-loose tracking-tight md:mb-2"><div class="md:max-w-xs flex flex-col md:items-end"><ul class="font-serif flex-grow-0 flex justify-between flex-wrap md:flex-col"><li class="px-1 md:px-0"><a href=/posts/ title="Posts page" class="font-medium text-medium-red-violet-600 hover:text-medium-red-violet-400">Posts</a></li><li class="px-1 md:px-0"><a href=/categories/ title="Categories page">Categories</a></li><li class="px-1 md:px-0"><a href=/tags/ title="Tags page">Tags</a></li><li class="px-1 md:px-0"><a href=/about/ title="About page">About</a></li></ul><div class="flex flex-wrap-reverse md:justify-end content-end md:content-start justify-start items-start max-h-16"></div><div class="text-sm text-gray-500 leading-tight a-gray"><br>Built with Hugo and theme <a href=https://github.com/heyeshuang/hugo-theme-tokiwa>Tokiwa</a>. 585 words in this page.</div></div></div></aside><footer class="w-full md:w-3/5 xl:w-1/2 order-3 max-w-3xl md:order-4 pt-2"><hr class=double-line><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between pb-2 leading-loose font-serif"><a class=flex-grow-0 href=/posts/optimizing-word-lookups/><svg class="fill-current inline-block h-4 w-4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24" height="24"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><path d="M7.828 11H20v2H7.828l5.364 5.364-1.414 1.414L4 12l7.778-7.778 1.414 1.414z"/></svg>Optimizing Word Lookups</a></div><div></div><hr><div class=pb-2></div><hr></footer><script src=/dist/app.js></script></div></body></html>
